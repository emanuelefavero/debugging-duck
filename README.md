# Debugging Duck

This is my first Electron Desktop Application, a cute rubber duck that helps you debug your code. Explain your code to the duck and it will help you find the bugs!

_If you want to read the origin of the debugging duck_: [Rubber duck debugging - wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

    cd debugging-duck
    npm i
    yarn start OR npm start
